### Synopsis

Welcome to my repo for the Makers Academy challenge: FINAL PROJECT WEEK!
During this time I worked in a small team to design and develop a full-stack web application that takes the user on a language-learning journey.

__Team Members__ :-
- Joshua Holloway - [GitHub](https://github.com/JoshuaJFHolloway)
- Hannah Lillis - [GitHub](https://github.com/hannahlillis)
- Kaari Strack (Me...)

Agile methodologies and XP values.

### Stack

React, HTML, CSS (inline styled components), Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Jest, Enzyme, Cypress.

### Implementation

1) Clone this repository, and change into the correct directory.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kaaristrack/LocalizR

Verify your installation by typing:
